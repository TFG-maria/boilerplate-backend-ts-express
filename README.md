# Boilerplate Backend (TypeScript, Node.js, Express)

## Description
This project is a boilerplate template for building backend applications using TypeScript, Node.js, and Express. It is designed to provide a solid foundation for creating scalable and maintainable RESTful APIs. The template includes a well-structured folder architecture and pre-configured tools to streamline development.

## Folder Structure
```

│   └── index.ts            # Entry point for the application
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

## Architecture Overview
The architecture follows a modular and layered approach to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability:

- **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests and delegate the processing to the appropriate services or business logic.
- **Models**: Represent the core business logic and use cases of the application.
- **Routes**: Define the API endpoints and map them to the corresponding controllers.
- **Entities**: Define the data structures and domain models used throughout the application.
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Facilitate data validation and transformation between layers.

This structure promotes clean code practices and makes it easier to extend or modify the application as needed.

## Note on Deployment
This repository is intended as a starting point for backend projects. Detailed deployment instructions will be provided in the project's wiki, covering various environments and best practices.
